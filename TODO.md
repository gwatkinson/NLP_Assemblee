# TODO List

* Training
  * [ ] 1. Define a pytorch lightning module
  * [ ] 2. Define the associated trainer
  * [ ] 3. List the metrics to be computed
    * Parameters of the model (name, params, ...)
    * Loss
    * Accuracy (weighted)
    * Other metrics ?
    * Time (s) / normalization ?
    * Time by epoch
    * Memory used in GPU
    * Number of parameters / fixed and trainable
    * Size of the model (the weights)
    * Number of epochs
    * Graphs artifacts (loss, accuracy, etc.)
  * [ ] 3. Run the trainings
  * [ ] 4. Log the results and analyze them
* Analysis
  * [ ] 1. Select the best model (or models) and analyze them
  * [ ] 2. Test on one example to show input and output
  * [ ] 3. Conduct analysis on the deputies and their evolution if possible
  * [ ] 4. Think of pertinant graphs and questions to answer
  * [ ] 5. Try ensemble learning
* Report
  * [ ] 1. Start the report
  * [ ] Citer https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10084.pdf
