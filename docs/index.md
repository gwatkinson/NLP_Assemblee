# NLP and French Politic

This site contains the documentation for NLP project for the Deep Learning course of the MVA.

This is a group project with Gabriel Watkinson and Jéremie Stym-Popper.

## Project Layout

There are mutliple distinct parts in this project.

### Getting the Data

First of all, we made use of an API made available by [nosdeputes.fr](https://www.nosdeputes.fr) to fetch the textual retranscription of every session at the French Assemblée Nationale.

* The API class is available in the [api.py](api/api.md) module.
<!-- * Then, we used a notebook [`scrapping.ipynb`](notebooks/scrapping.ipynb) to fetch the data using the API. -->

### Building the Models
